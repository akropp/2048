# 2048 Game

A browser-based implementation of the popular 2048 puzzle game with smooth animations and a clean interface.

## Features

- Classic 2048 gameplay mechanics
- Smooth animations for tile movements and appearances

- Game over detection when no more moves are possible

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move all tiles on the grid
2. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one with their sum
3. After each move, a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 appears in a random empty cell
4. The goal is to create a tile with the value 2048
5. The game ends when there are no more valid moves (the grid is full and no adjacent tiles have the same value)

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with animations and transitions)
